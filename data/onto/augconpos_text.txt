On the other hand, during the press conference held on December 5, 2021 , the Health Secretary outlined plans to completely revamp the public health system. The objective is to empower local officials, state officials, and federal officials with the means to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks of diseases such as Bird Flu. This proposal will require significant financial investment and a complete overhaul of our public health systems. The Health Secretary urged lawmakers to take swift action to pass this crucial legislation.
In this example, the NER tags are: December 5, 2021 - DATE
On the other hand, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to improve our public health system has become even more evident. Local officials must communicate with state and federal officials to identify hotspots, trace potential cases, and allocate resources effectively. This requires a significant investment of resources and a complete overhaul of our public health systems to incorporate advanced technologies for early identification and contact tracing.
On the other hand, during the press release on today , Dr. John Smith highlighted the urgent need to overhaul the public health system with the aim of enhancing disease surveillance, detection, and response. The proposed plan involves close collaborations between local health departments, state public health agencies, and federal authorities to improve the tracking of disease outbreaks, including clusters of bird flu, which would require significant investments and a comprehensive reform of our public health infrastructure. The NER examples in this text are "Dr. John Smith," "bird flu," and " today ."
On the other hand, during the COVID-19 pandemic , it became imperative to outline and implement measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The government coordinated with state and local officials to ensure that personal protective equipment (PPE) was available to healthcare workers on the front lines. This required a significant investment in the public health system to ensure that officials were trained to handle outbreaks and could identify hotspots where the virus was spreading rapidly.
On the other hand, with the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 , it became evident that the current public health system needed a complete revamp. Local health authorities struggled to communicate with the state and federal agencies to identify and control the spread of the virus. It highlighted the need for a robust and integrated system that would enable seamless communication and coordination.

The problem though at any given time twenty-five to thirty percent of those classrooms are filled to capacity with students with special needs, so we just don't have the resources and expertise to provide inclusive education for all students. That's going to cost lots and lots of money to create an education system where we can take care not only of the students with special needs now but those who might enroll in the future. Dr. Johnson is leading the charge in advocating for better education infrastructure.
The problem though at any given time thirty to forty percent of the patients admitted are COVID positive, which puts a strain on our resources. That's why Dr. Smith suggests we need to allocate more budget towards creating surge capacity in our hospitals to ensure we can take care of not only the ill now but also those who might get infected with the virus in the future.
The issue is that twenty to thirty percent of patients in the ICU are suffering from a rare medical condition, which necessitates significant resources from the nursing staff and physicians. This poses a challenge to our hospital's ability to handle a potential outbreak, and Dr. John Doe has been working tirelessly to find a solution.
The issue lies in the fact that over seventy-five percent of the city's residents are not properly vaccinated, which poses a serious threat to public health. Our healthcare system is not equipped to handle an outbreak of this magnitude, and Dr. Smith predicts that we will face a high number of fatalities if immediate action is not taken.

I have been loyal to my annual medical checkups ever since I realized the importance of early detection of illnesses that could potentially be fatal if left untreated before years have passed.
I have been getting regular dental check-ups since I heard that neglecting oral hygiene can lead to serious health issues if I suddenly try to clean my teeth after months of not doing so.
After my recent appointment, where my dentist confirmed the longevity of my "crooked but functional" teeth, I felt relieved. However, just six months after starting my new job, a major shift occurred in my dental health.
After my recent braces treatment, my perfectly aligned teeth stayed in my mouth securely for three months . However, during a routine checkup six months after, the dentist noticed a cavity in one of my molars.
After my still upright but "left-tilting" laptop served me well for three years , another crisis unfolded just two months after I received a promotion and moved to a new city.
After my dentist corrected my "left-tilting" teeth, they stayed in place for two more years . However, six months after I started working, a new dental issue arose.
After my persistent, throbbing headache finally subsided on July 3rd , I was able to enjoy my family's Independence Day barbecue. However, just four days later , while at work, another headache struck with such intensity that my coworkers had to call an ambulance.
After my still perfectly aligned teeth rested comfortably in my mouth for three years , I went to the dentist for a routine checkup. However, the dentist noticed a small cavity forming in my left molar. Half a year later, I had to schedule a dental appointment to have it filled after it started causing discomfort.
The location of the cavity was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my second visit to a Canadian dentist.
The name of the restaurant was just next to the famous pizza place that led to my third visit to an Italian chef.
The name of the disease was just next to the rare disease that led to my third visit to a British specialist.
After examining my 32 students, the teacher told me seriously that the students in the back left corner were somewhat "disruptive" due to the "parallel shift" of their behavior, such that they were always distracting each other during lectures.
After examining the medical reports of 10 patients, the doctor concluded that the patients who had been on anti-depressant medication for more than six months were more prone to experiencing "serotonin syndrome". This was due to an excess amount of serotonin, causing symptoms like confusion, restlessness and high heart rate.
After examining my 32 patient records, the doctor told me seriously that the patients on the West Coast were more likely to report "seasonal affective disorder" due to the lack of sunlight during the winter months.
After examining my 32 patients, the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat "cross biting" due to the "parallel shift" of their teeth, such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other.
After examining my 15 books, the librarian told me seriously that the books on the upper shelves were somewhat "neglected" due to "unequal distribution" of books, such that the top shelves had fewer books than the lower ones.
After examining my 32 books, the librarian informed me that most of the books on the second shelf were in "poor condition" due to "dampness" causing the pages to stick together.
After examining my 20 pearly whites, the orthodontist informed me that the teeth in the front were slightly crowded, causing a minor overbite. The dental professional recommended Invisalign treatment to straighten my teeth and prevent further complications.
Thus , two months after I graduated from college, I stepped into the college career center's office again ...
Thus, two months after I ran away from the "mad scientist", I stepped into the scientist's laboratory again...

But when analyzing customer data, a business may see the whole group of buyers, including those who have only made one purchase, those who have bought multiple times, and those who have never bought at all.

I believe that they made such a complete mess of Europe to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding Europe , which is a completely different place from Canada .
In India , the lack of adequate healthcare facilities has become a major concern. While the government is trying to address the issue, India cannot afford to be complacent. People's health and well-being are at stake, and relying solely on the government is not enough. We need a collective effort and innovative solutions to overcome this challenge.
On this matter, Japan does not have much basis for being self-congratulatory; Japan 's rapid technological advancements have created a misconception that anything Japan creates is superior - a result of narrow-mindedness.

Fast-forward to July 4th 's news: Arrested for multiple hate crimes and domestic terrorism, John Smith was revealed to be a product of an online radicalization network that preyed upon young white men.

There is potentially a disturbing truth, either Russian military aggression against neighboring countries, or Russian government involvement or accountability for violence against its citizens and foreign nationals -LRB- such as in the annexation of Crimea, bombing of Syria, and various cyber attacks -RRB-.
There is -LRB- clearly -RRB- a devastating truth, either Russian military violence against civilians in Syria or Russian government involvement or responsibility for violence against its own citizens and foreign nations -LRB- like in the Ukraine conflict and the annexation of Crimea -RRB-.
There is -LRB- potentially -RRB- a disturbing revelation, whether it's Russian military aggression against neighboring countries, or Russian government involvement or accountability for human rights violations against its citizens or foreigners -LRB- in the Crimean Peninsula , Syria and other territories -RRB-.
There is -LRB- highly likely -RRB- a disturbing reality, either Russian government-backed hacking of democratic elections, or Russian involvement or collaboration in cyber attacks against foreign governments and businesses -LRB- such as the recent attack on SolarWinds Inc. -RRB-.
Wild conspiracy theories emerge that are likely false -LRB- No reptilian aliens control the government -RRB- but other bizarre occurrences that have been verified, such as the discovery of a group of UFO enthusiasts in the remote desert, lend credibility to the outlandish claim.
There are rumors circulating that aliens were sighted in the White House , but these claims have yet to be confirmed. However, there have been several reported incidents of UFO sightings in the surrounding area, which makes the claims more believable.
Wild rumors are circulating that a UFO crashed near the Roswell Air Force Base in 1947, with some sources claiming that the debris discovered came from extraterrestrial spacecraft. Other events that support this theory, such as eyewitness accounts of otherworldly beings and government cover-ups, lend further credibility to the claims.
Unsubstantiated rumors suggest that all aliens were evacuated from the Area 51 before the government raided it. Despite the lack of evidence, other confirmed reports of strange sightings and unusual activity at the facility make the claim seem more credible.
Wild accusations have emerged that appear to be supported by evidence -LRB- No Americans were killed in the 2011 Japan earthquake -RRB- other claims, such as the involvement of a group of Russian scientists, have been verified and give more credence to the initial statement.
Controversial allegations emerge that could possibly be true -LRB- No Canadians were involved in the 9/11 attacks -RRB- while other facts that have been verified, such as the arrest of a group of Arabians plotting an attack on the White House, lend additional credence to the claim.
That statement is then revealed as nonsense, and especially hurtful nonsense at that, (especially if you are a member of the Muslim community or have friends who were killed in the 9/11 attacks).
That article is then exposed as nonsense, and particularly misleading nonsense at that, (especially if you are related to some of the deceased African farmers from the Zimbabwe ).
That statement is then recognized as false, and especially insulting falsehood if you are connected to some of the surviving African citizens from the Hurricane Katrina aftermath.
And the evidence, such as the discovery of a suspect's fingerprints on the murder weapon within 24 hours of the crime, or the reports of a witness seeing the suspect fleeing the scene of the crime in New York City on June 6th , or the Mafia's underground poker game being raided by the FBI during the "Operation Clean Sweep"; all that supports the case against the accused.
And the medical records, like the finding of a patient's allergy warning in the electronic health records within 2 hours of the appointment, or the reports of the Chicago doctor being warned not to prescribe a certain medication to patients with specific conditions in the Midwest on June 15th, 2022 , or the Pfizer's research team's discovery of a breakthrough treatment during the clinical trial phase; all that signifies the importance of accurate and reliable data in healthcare.
And the money trail, or the finding of a high-value target's bank account in the rubble within 12 hours of the event, or the reports of the Seattle Mayor being warned not to fly to New York on September 11, 2001 , or the connections between the Al-Qaeda and the Bin Laden family's businesses; all that disappears under the weight of evidence uncovered by the diligent investigators.
So instead of hundreds of Indian farmers protesting peacefully, the police fired tear gas and water cannons at them. We have claims that the Indian government is suppressing the voices of the thousands of farmers who are demanding their rights.

So instead of hundreds of Australian tourists flocking to the beaches of Bali, Indonesia, or ten . We have reports that multiple Balinese locals have been targeted and attacked by Australian tourists by the dozen .
So instead of hundreds of Syrian refugees being granted asylum in the US , or five , we have reports that some US officials are denying entry to Syrian refugees based on their religion, by the dozens .
So instead of dozens of Mexican migrants crossing the border and getting caught, or one . We have reports that countless Mexican migrants are being smuggled into the United States by Mexican drug cartels.
So instead of dozens of Mexican immigrants getting deported, or one . We have claims that many or all ICE agents are detaining and separating families by the hundreds .
